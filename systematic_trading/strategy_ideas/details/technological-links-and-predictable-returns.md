## Trading rules

- Investment universe includes stocks of firms with non-missing market equity and SIC classification code from CRSP, and non-negative book equity data at the end of previous fiscal year from COMPUSTAT
- Firms must have at least one patent granted in the rolling-window of past five years
- Excluded are financial firms with one-digit SIC codes of six and stocks that are priced below one dollar a share at the beginning of the holding period to reduce the impact of micro-cap stocks
- Technology-linked return (TECHRET) is measured as the average monthly return of technology-linked firms in the technology space, weighted by pairwise technology closeness
- Technology closeness (TECH) between firms is defined as the uncentered correlation between all pairs, counted for every firm i, and month t, based on the number of patents in USPTO technology class over the rolling past five years
- TECH acts as a weight in calculating the average stock return of technology-linked firms and is biased toward firms which are more technologically close to the focal firm.
- TECHRET for firm i and month t is defined as a sum for every i different from j of TECHij multiplied by RETj (past month return of technology-linked firm j) divided by sum of TECHij for every i different from j
- At the beginning of each month, sort all firms into deciles based on the return of their technology-linked portfolios in the previous month
- Long the top decile and short the bottom decile
- Portfolio is value-weighted and rebalanced monthly.

## Python code

### Backtrader
