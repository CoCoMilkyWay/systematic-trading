## Trading rules

Here are the trading rules for this strategy:

- The investment universe consists of global stocks from developed markets (North America, EU, Asia-Pacific).
- Global stocks are sorted into six portfolios at the end of each month, based on market capitalization and earnings yield.
- Firm level earnings yields are created every month as the ratio of earnings per share to stock prices at the end of each month.
- Earnings per share are the average of earnings forecasts for fiscal years t, t+1 and t+2, using mean I/B/E/S forecasts as of the third Thursday of each month.
- Negative earnings forecasts and earnings yields above 100% per year are treated as missing.
- Stocks are first sorted into ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù market capitalization bins at the end of June every year based on the median NYSE market capitalization break points from Ken French‚Äôs website.
- Within each size bin, stocks are further sorted based on their earnings yields at the end of each month.
- Stocks are sorted into ‚Äúlow‚Äù (bottom 30%), ‚Äúmedium‚Äù (mid 40%), and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (top 30%) earnings yield portfolios within each size bin.
- Investor goes long high earnings yield big stocks and short low earnings yield big stocks.
- Portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced monthly.
