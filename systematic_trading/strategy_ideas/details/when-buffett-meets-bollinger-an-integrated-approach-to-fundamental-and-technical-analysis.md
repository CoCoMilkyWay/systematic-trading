## Trading rules

- Investment universe: non-financial NYSE and AMEX-listed firms (excluding foreign companies, closed-end funds, REITs, ADRs, stocks priced below $1, and negative book-to-market ratio stocks)
- Narrow universe to top quintile of firms with highest book-to-market ratio
- Perform triple sort:
    1. Select top quintile (winner) and bottom quintile (loser) stocks based on 12-month momentum
    2. Calculate BOS ratio (covariance of 12-month return and average volume)
    3. Choose lowest BOS ratio stocks from winner portfolio and highest BOS ratio stocks from loser portfolio
- Calculate FSCORE for each stock in winner and loser portfolios
- Go long on top quintile of winner stocks with highest FSCORE ratio and short on bottom quintile of loser stocks with lowest FSCORE ratio
- Rebalance one-third of the portfolio monthly
- Optimal holding period: 3 months
- Equal stock weighting

- **Annual Return:** 48.67%
- **Maximum Drawdown:** N/A
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.99
- **Annual Standard Deviation:** 45%
