## Trading rules

- Investment universe includes currency forwards, equity indices, and index futures.
- Consider relationships between asset classes: Bonds have negative effect on FX and positive effect on Equities; Equities have negative effect on Bonds and negative effect on FX; FX has positive effect on Equities and positive effect on Bonds.
- Pick lookback period from 3 to 4 years.
- Signal is defined as the signum function of the cumulative returns for the asset that has a spillover on another from date t minus the lookback period to date t.
- Allocate one-third of the overall risk budget to each asset class.
- Equal risk contribution within asset classes.
- Weights are obtained from a maximization of the sum of natural logarithms of weights in the absolute values.
- Rebalance weekly.
- Form summary strategy from 6 strategies: spillover of bonds to FX and equities, spillover of equities on FX and bonds, and spillover of FX to bonds and equities.
