## Trading rules

- Obtain data on actively managed, open-ended U.S. equity mutual funds (e.g., from CRSP Survivor-Bias Free US Mutual Fund database)
- Exclude financial firms and firms with a price below $1 at the end of the month
- Compute the momentum competition metric:
    - At the end of month t-1, calculate returns over the interval (t-12, t-2) and standardize each stockâ€™s return to a z-score
    - Locate each mutual fund in the one-dimensional momentum space based on the value-weighted location of the stocks it holds
    - Define two funds as competitors at time t if the interfund distance is less than or equal to a chosen parameter for target granularity
    - Compute the competition metric based on the similarity between a fund and its spatially proximate rivals
    - Average the competition measure across all funds holding a particular stock
- At the end of each month t-1:
    - Sort stocks into terciles by momentum competition
    - Sort stocks within the lowest competition tercile into quintile portfolios based on their traditional 12-month momentum
    - Long the highest quintile and short the lowest quintile
- Employ a value-weighted strategy and rebalance monthly

## Statistics

- **Period of Rebalancing:** Monthly
- **Backtest period:** 1980-2012
- **Annual Return:** 18%
- **Maximum Drawdown:** N/A
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.58
- **Annual Standard Deviation:** 23.95%

                self.order_target_percent(stock, target=0.0)

cerebro = bt.Cerebro()

# Add data feeds and other settings to cerebro here

cerebro.addstrategy(MomentumCompetition)
results = cerebro.run()
```

Please note that the code provided is just a template and you will need to implement the logic to compute the momentum competition metric, as well as add data feeds and other settings to cerebro as required.
