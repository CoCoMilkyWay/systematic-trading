## Trading rules

- Use next-month fed funds futures 3 days prior to FOMC announcement to calculate target rate change.
- Calculate fed funds futures spread over the target by finding the difference between expected target rate and the fed funds target rate.
- Long dollar against basket of developed currencies if spread is greater or equal to 12.5 bps.
- Short dollar against basket of developed currencies if spread is lower or equal to -12.5 bps.
- No action is taken if the spread is between -12.5 and 12.5 bps.
- Leverage ratio of 5 to 1 is used.
- Buy 2 days before FOMC announcement, and sell in the afternoon of the FOMC announcement day.
