## Trading rules

- Use 5 U.S. Treasuries ETFs with different maturities
- Look at absolute momentum of each asset by centering momentum search around 9 months and neglecting previous monthâ€™s return
- Utilize return of 1-year Treasuries to calculate excess return of each asset
- Include any asset exhibiting positive momentum in portfolio
- If no assets are exhibiting positive momentum, give full weight to 1-year U.S. Treasuries
- Focus on relative momentum by using ranks of assets instead of specific values of risk-adjusted return
- Rankweight assets based on weights proportional to excess return divided by variance
- Rebalance portfolio on monthly basis

## Statistics

- **Markets Traded:** U.S. Treasuries
- **Period of Rebalancing:** Monthly
- **Backtest period:** 1962-2014
- **Annual Return:** 7%
- **Maximum Drawdown:** -6%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1
- **Annual Standard Deviation:** 5%

## Python code
