## Trading rules

- Investment universe consists of S&P 500.
- Consider 15 forecasting variables for predicting the one-month ahead equity risk premium.
- Normalize all predictors by dividing by their standard deviations using a backward-looking window of 500 days.
- Use a weighted least square method (WLS) with a decay factor of 0.99 at monthly frequency to estimate the WLS specification.
- Incorporate a bidirectional stepwise procedure in the WLS specification.
- Variables are chosen based on the Akaike Information Criterion.
- Obtain model parameters at the end of month t-1 and hold them constant for month t.
- Use updated return predictors along with fixed model parameters to produce one-month equity risk premium forecasts on a daily frequency.
- Re-estimate the model using an expanding window each month to obtain new parameter values used for the next monthâ€™s equity premium forecasts.
- Amount invested in the market is determined by transforming the raw equity premium forecasts.
- Equity premium forecasts are scaled by the inverse of the root mean square error (RMSE) and multiplied by five to produce the percentual amount invested in the S&P 500.
- Invest the rest in Treasury-bills.
- If the equity premium forecast is negative, invest everything in Treasury-bills.
